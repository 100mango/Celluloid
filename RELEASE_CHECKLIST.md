# Celluloid modernization and release gates

## Preserved shipping contract

- App `Mango.Celluloid`, extension `Mango.Celluloid.CelluloidPhotoExtension`, framework `Mango.CelluloidKit`; historical Apple ID 1124966798
- Image editing, all original filters, editable bubbles/stickers, two/three/four-photo collage layouts, photo saving/sharing, iPhone/iPad portrait and landscape, and Photos editing extension
- Non-destructive Photos adjustment identifier `Mango.CelluloidPhotoExtension`, version `1.0`; same keyed-archive dictionary, raw preset names and NSValue geometry; absent empty arrays supported
- SnapKit 5.7.1 via SwiftPM replaces the active CocoaPods graph. Obsolete picker/presentation/dispatch/color/serialization dependencies use system frameworks or narrow local code. Historical vendored sources/licenses remain attribution-only and are not linked

## Reproducible validation

Run `python3 Scripts/generate_project.py` after adding source/resources. Open the workspace; no pod install is needed. The shared Celluloid scheme includes unit and UI regression targets.

The GitHub workflow verifies stable Xcode 27.0 and the iOS 27.0 runtime before building. One job runs unit/UI tests serially on an available iPhone and iPad simulator, seeds a generated RGB fixture into Photos, grants simulator Photos access, and builds an unsigned device archive including the extension. Logs, xcresult bundles and an xcresult summary are generated on the runner. No artifact/cache upload or paid runner is configured.

Coverage includes legacy archive compatibility, malformed archive rejection, all presets/assets, filter pixels/orientation, repeat state restoration, rendering, extension adjustment validation/cancel, collage polygons, permission-denied recovery, limited/empty library management, repeat cancel, background/foreground, rotation, seeded photo edit/save/reopen. Permission-denied/limited UI states use DEBUG-only injected authorization states; they do not prove the system limited-library picker itself works.

## Remaining release gates

- Passing CI for the exact final commit; Linux source checks are not an Apple build or runtime test
- Physical devices: large images, memory pressure, EXIF orientation, iCloud failures/offline recovery, save failure/retry, camera-originated photos, iPad multitasking and accessible text sizes
- Real Photos host: enable extension, edit/cancel/save, reopen old v1 edits and revert to original; unit tests do not establish host integration
- Confirm old release signing/team/entitlements, actual App Store Connect version/build, Developer membership and app ownership; current source version/build deliberately unchanged pending store evidence
- Supply/approve original-quality 1024px marketing artwork; historic catalog lacks a marketing icon
- Audit app/dependency privacy declarations against final code. No tracking/collection claims are inferred from the repository alone; no sensitive credentials or signing material belong in source
- App Store metadata, privacy/support URL, age rating, encryption/export declarations, review credentials if applicable, distribution signing and final authorized submission

No merge, signing, TestFlight upload, App Store submission or release is performed by this workflow.
